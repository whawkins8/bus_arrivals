# bus_arrivals

Sometimes Google Maps is dead wrong about when buses are going to arrive.

I'm making this program to send desktop notifications when your bus is either
a certain time away from your stop, or when the bus is passing a certain stop on the way to 
your stop, just to help me leave my house in time to catch the bus. I'll leave it to the 
user to decide how to configure the alert.
